	<h3>Car Maintenance Tips</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>The Oil</dt>
		<dd>Changing oil is one of the basic car maintenance procedures, and checking your oil is an easy way to identify leaks. You can check your oil level easily by simply pulling out the dipstick and seeing where the oil is. Take your car in for an oil change on a regular basis.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt> The Tyre Pressure</dt>
		<dd>Tyres that are improperly inflated can cause blowouts that can cause accidents. Additionally, the wrong level of inflation disturbs your fuel efficiency. It’s important to check them regularly.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>The Brakes</dt>
		<dd>Don’t wait for the screeching sound to tell you the brake pads are getting old. The brakes help to stop your car and prevent an accident, so it’s best to have a mechanic check your brakes as part of regular maintenance.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>The Power Steering Fluid</dt>
		<dd>Without power steering fluid your power steering could fail, making it harder to control your car. Like your oil, it can be checked and refilled by yourself.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt> The Alignment</dt>
		<dd>Get your alignment adjusted as needed to ensure your car will steer and react the way you want it to when you need to move quickly.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt> The Antifreeze/Coolant</dt>
		<dd>In winters, make sure that you have enough antifreeze in your car to ensure proper run. Cold temperatures are hard on your car.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>The Tyre Tread</dt>
		<dd>Tyres depend on the tread to give you traction on the road, and it’s very important in slippery conditions. Look for signs of wear in your tyres and also look for any bulges or odd lumps that could indicate a problem.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt> The Air Filter</dt>
		<dd>A clogged air filter will affect fuel consumption. Make it a regular part of your car maintenance routine to check the air filter.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt> The Transmission Fluid</dt>
		<dd>Make sure that the transmission fluid is always at a good level and is changed periodically to make sure your car can shift smoothly and keep you in control of the car at all times.</dd>
		<dt> The Lights – All of Them</dt>
		<dd>Having any of the lights on your car not functioning properly is dangerous. Be sure to check your turn signals, brake lights, reverse lights, and of course, your headlights on a regular basis. These lights and indicators let other vehicles know what you are doing or about to do, and this, in turn, prevents accidents.</dd>
